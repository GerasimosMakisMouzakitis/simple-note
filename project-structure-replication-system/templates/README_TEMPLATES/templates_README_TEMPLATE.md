- Rename copied file appropriately for your use case
- Customize the copy, not the original

### **Maintain Template Integrity**
- Don't remove sections from templates unless absolutely necessary
- Keep the systematic structure that ensures completeness
- If customizing, document why certain sections were modified

## üîß **Template Maintenance**

### **Version Control**
- Templates are version controlled with the rest of the project
- Changes to templates require documentation of rationale
- Consider backward compatibility when updating templates

### **Quality Assurance**
- Test template changes with sample use cases
- Ensure all placeholders are clearly marked
- Verify templates produce complete, professional documentation

### **Updates and Improvements**
- Templates improved based on usage experience
- Collect feedback from team members using templates
- Balance consistency with practical usability
