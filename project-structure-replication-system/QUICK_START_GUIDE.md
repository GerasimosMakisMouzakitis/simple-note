## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP PROJECT STRUCTURE SETUP**

### **Phase 1: Create Folder Structure (5 minutes)**

```
Please create this exact folder structure in my workspace root:

project-docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current-development/ 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed-features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ naming-analysis/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comparisons/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assessments/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-rules/

backups/
```

### **Phase 2: Copy Core Templates (10 minutes)**

```
From the project-structure-replication-system/templates/ folder, copy these files to project-docs/templates/:

1. TASK_BREAKDOWN_TEMPLATE.md
2. COMPLETION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md  
3. COMPARISON_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md
4. NAMING_CONVENTION_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md
5. Rules_TEMPLATE.md

Also copy all files from README_TEMPLATES/ subfolder to project-docs/templates/
```

### **Phase 3: Setup Project Rules (5 minutes)**

```
1. Copy Rules_TEMPLATE.md to project-docs/project-rules/Rules.md
2. Replace these placeholders in the Rules.md file:
   - [PROJECT_NAME] ‚Üí (my actual project name)
   - [TEAM_NAME] ‚Üí (my team/developer name)  
   - [GITHUB_REPO] ‚Üí (my GitHub repository name)
   - [VERSION_PATTERN] ‚Üí v1.0.0 (or my preferred pattern)
```

### **Phase 4: Create Initial Documentation (10 minutes)**

```
Create README.md files in each folder using the templates:

1. Copy project-docs_README_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí project-docs/README.md
2. Copy templates_README_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí project-docs/templates/README.md  
3. Copy current-development_README_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí project-docs/current-development/README.md
4. Copy completed-features_README_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí project-docs/completed-features/README.md
5. Copy reports_README_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí project-docs/reports/README.md

Customize each README with my project-specific information.
```

### **Phase 5: Setup First Task (5 minutes)**

```
1. Copy TASK_BREAKDOWN_TEMPLATE.md to project-docs/current-development/TASK_BREAKDOWN_Project-Setup.md
2. Fill in the template with:
   - Task: "Project Structure Setup"  
   - Category: "Infrastructure"
   - Priority: "High"
   - Use this as practice for the systematic approach
```

### **Phase 6: Initialize Git Tracking (2 minutes)**

```
Commit the new structure:
git add project-docs/ backups/
git commit -m "Add professional project organization system

- 5-folder documentation structure
- 13+ professional templates  
- Systematic development workflow
- Zero naming conflicts design"
```

---

## üéØ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

```
After setup, verify I have:
‚úÖ 5 main folders created (project-docs, backups)
‚úÖ All templates copied to project-docs/templates/
‚úÖ Rules.md customized with my project info
‚úÖ README files in each major folder
‚úÖ First task breakdown created
‚úÖ Everything committed to git
‚úÖ Structure ready for systematic development
```

---

## üîÑ **DAILY WORKFLOW** 

```
For each new feature:
1. Copy TASK_BREAKDOWN_TEMPLATE.md to current-development/
2. Plan systematically using the 8-phase structure
3. Work through tasks methodically  
4. Create COMPLETION_SUMMARY when done
5. Move completed files to completed-features/ with versioning
6. Update project documentation as needed
```

---

## üìÅ **FILE NAMING RULES**

```
Current Development:
- TASK_BREAKDOWN_FeatureName.md
- COMPLETION_SUMMARY_FeatureName.md

Completed Features (after finishing):
- TASK_BREAKDOWN_v1.1.0_FeatureName_2025-09-26.md
- COMPLETION_SUMMARY_v1.1.0_FeatureName_2025-09-26.md

Reports:
- COMPARISON_TopicName_2025-09-26.md
- NAMING_ANALYSIS_2025-09-26.md
```

## ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

```
After VS Code chat completes the setup:
1. Verify all folders and files are created correctly
2. Open project-docs/current-development/TASK_BREAKDOWN_Project-Setup.md
3. Start planning my first real feature using the systematic approach
4. Follow the proven 8-phase development process
5. Use templates for all documentation going forward
```
