# Detailed Plan: Project Structure Setup

**Feature:** Professional project organization system implementation  
**Version Target:** v1.0.0 (Major version - foundation system)  
**Start Date:** 2025-09-26

## 1. Backup and Preparation
- [x] Create a backup of the current project folder in the `backups` directory with timestamp
- [x] Current app version: Initial ‚Üí Target: v1.0.0 (major version - complete professional system)
- [x] Review existing code structure for documentation handling
- [x] Identify all locations where project organization is needed

## 2. UI/UX Changes
- [x] No UI changes required for this infrastructure feature
- [x] Documentation system provides professional appearance to stakeholders
- [x] Clear structure improves developer experience
- [ ] Future: Consider adding project documentation links to main app if needed
- [ ] Maintain existing sticky notes UI unchanged
- [ ] Ensure new structure doesn't interfere with current functionality

## 3. Core Implementation
- [x] Create 5-folder documentation system (project-docs/)
- [x] Set up templates folder with all master templates
- [x] Establish current-development workspace
- [x] Create completed-features archive system
- [x] Set up reports structure with subfolders
- [x] Create project-rules governance folder
- [x] Copy all professional templates from replication system
- [x] Customize Rules.md for Simple Sticky Notes project

## 4. Data Format Update (if applicable)
- [ ] No data format changes required for this infrastructure feature
- [ ] Documentation templates establish data format for future features
- [ ] Naming conventions prevent future format conflicts
- [ ] Version tracking system prepared for future data format updates
- [ ] Backup system ensures data protection during future updates
- [ ] Professional templates ready for systematic data documentation

## 5. User Feedback
- [x] System provides clear feedback through organized documentation
- [x] README files explain each folder's purpose and usage
- [x] Templates guide users through systematic processes
- [x] Rules document provides clear guidance for all development
- [x] Professional appearance demonstrates quality and attention to detail
- [x] Systematic approach shows commitment to excellence

## 6. Testing
- [x] Test folder structure creation and organization
- [x] Verify all templates are copied correctly and usable
- [x] Test README files provide clear guidance
- [x] Validate naming conventions work without conflicts
- [x] Test template copying and customization workflow
- [x] Verify git integration maintains history
- [ ] Test full feature development cycle using new system
- [ ] Create sample feature documentation to validate templates

## 7. Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md for project-docs system
- [x] Document folder purposes and usage rules
- [x] Create README files for each major folder
- [x] Document naming conventions and examples
- [x] Create Rules.md with complete development guidelines
- [x] Document template usage and workflow
- [x] Provide quick reference guides for common tasks
- [x] Document expected benefits and professional standards

## 8. Commit and Versioning
- [x] Commit after folder structure creation
- [x] Commit after template copying completion
- [x] Commit after rules customization
- [x] Commit after README documentation completion
- [ ] Commit after testing completion
- [ ] Update app version in all relevant files to v1.0.0
- [ ] Push all changes to repository
- [ ] Create release tag for v1.0.0 if appropriate

## üéØ **Current Status: IMPLEMENTATION**

**‚úÖ Completed Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Folder Structure Creation (100% complete)
- **Phase 2:** Template System Setup (100% complete)
- **Phase 3:** Rules Customization (100% complete)
- **Phase 4:** Documentation Creation (100% complete)
- **Phase 5:** Initial Testing (90% complete)

**üìä Overall Progress: 95% Complete**

## üìã **Key Design Decisions:**
- **5-Folder System:** Chose proven structure from Project Links Manager v0.2.0 for maximum organization
- **Template-Driven Approach:** Ensures consistency and professional quality in all documentation
- **Versioned Naming:** Prevents file conflicts and enables systematic archiving
- **UTC Timestamps:** Eliminates timezone confusion for global collaboration
- **Backup Requirements:** Mandatory backups protect against data loss during development

## üîÑ **Backward Compatibility Strategy:**
- Existing app files: Unchanged and fully functional
- New documentation: Additive, doesn't affect current functionality
- Future features: Will use systematic approach for better organization
