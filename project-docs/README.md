# Project Documentation System

**Project:** Simple Sticky Notes Web App  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-26

## 📁 **Documentation Structure**

This project uses a systematic 5-folder documentation approach for professional project management:

```
project-docs/
├── templates/              [Master Templates - DO NOT EDIT]
├── current-development/    [Active Work]
├── completed-features/     [Archived Completed Work]
├── reports/               [Analysis & Assessment Documents]
│   ├── naming-analysis/
│   ├── comparisons/
│   └── assessments/
└── project-rules/         [Development Guidelines]
```

## 🎯 **Folder Purposes**

### **📄 templates/**
- **Purpose:** Master template files for consistent documentation
- **Contents:** Template files for task breakdowns, completion summaries, reports
- **Rule:** NEVER edit these files directly - always copy to use
- **Naming:** Keep original template names unchanged

### **🔨 current-development/**
- **Purpose:** Active feature development and current work
- **Contents:** Task breakdowns, planning documents, work in progress
- **Rule:** Move files to completed-features/ when work is finished
- **Naming:** Descriptive names, rename with versioning when moving to archive

### **✅ completed-features/**
- **Purpose:** Permanent archive of finished features and implementations
- **Contents:** Completed task breakdowns, summaries, version documentation
- **Rule:** Use strict versioned naming convention
- **Naming:** `[FILE_TYPE]_v[VERSION]_[FEATURE-NAME]_[COMPLETION-DATE].md`

### **📊 reports/**
- **Purpose:** Analysis documents, comparisons, and assessments
- **Contents:** Technical analysis, comparison reports, naming analyses
- **Rule:** Use systematic naming for easy reference
- **Naming:** `[REPORT_TYPE]_[SUBJECT]_[DATE].md`

### **📋 project-rules/**
- **Purpose:** Development rules, guidelines, and project governance
- **Contents:** Rules.md, coding standards, workflow documentation
- **Rule:** Changes require team consensus and documentation
- **Naming:** Descriptive, stable names (rarely changed)

## 🔄 **Workflow**

### **Starting New Features**
1. Copy appropriate template from `templates/` to `current-development/`
2. Customize template for your specific feature
3. Use template to guide systematic development
4. Update template with progress and decisions

### **Completing Features**
1. Copy completion summary template to `current-development/`
2. Document all achievements and implementation details
3. Move both task breakdown and summary to `completed-features/`
4. Use proper versioned naming convention

### **Making Decisions**
1. Use comparison report template for significant technical choices
2. Document alternatives considered and selection rationale
3. Include implementation recommendations
4. Store in appropriate `reports/` subfolder

## 📝 **Naming Conventions**

### **Completed Features**
```
[FILE_TYPE]_v[VERSION]_[FEATURE-NAME]_[COMPLETION-DATE].md
```

**Examples:**
- `TASK_BREAKDOWN_v1.0.0_Sticky-Notes-App_2025-09-26.md`
- `COMPLETION_SUMMARY_v1.1.0_Export-Function_2025-10-15.md`

### **Reports**
```
[REPORT_TYPE]_[SUBJECT]_[DATE].md
```

**Examples:**
- `COMPARISON_REPORT_Storage-Options_2025-09-26.md`
- `NAMING_CONVENTION_ANALYSIS_2025-09-26.md`

## 🎯 **Benefits of This System**

## 📚 **Quick Reference**

### **Need to start a new feature?**
→ Copy `TASK_BREAKDOWN_TEMPLATE.md` from templates/ to current-development/

### **Finished implementing something?**
→ Copy `COMPLETION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md` and document your work

### **Need to make a technical decision?**
→ Use `COMPARISON_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` to analyze options

### **Files getting disorganized?**
→ Use `NAMING_CONVENTION_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md` to fix naming issues

### **Need to update project rules?**
→ Check project-rules/Rules.md for current standards

## ⚠️ **Important Reminders**

- **NEVER edit files in templates/** - they are master copies
- **Always use UTC timestamps** in documentation
- **Create backups** before major changes
- **Follow naming conventions exactly** in completed-features/
- **Move completed work** from current-development/ to completed-features/
